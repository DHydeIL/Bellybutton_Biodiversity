# Bellybutton Biodiversity
## Project Overview
The eventual purpose of this project is to discover unknown bacteria which are capable of synthesizing proteins that taste like beef, so these bacteria can be used in the creation of meat alternatives. The search for new bacteria is taking place on the human body, which is incredibly biodiverse; in particular, bacterial samples are being taken from the bellybutton region of a selection of human volunteers. This data has been collected [here](samples.json) and is being displayed on a [dashboard](https://dhydeil.github.io/Bellybutton_Biodiversity/) to be examined. The dashboard contains a drop-down menu to select the test subjects' data by their id number, and displays the test subjects' demographic info, a bar chart of their top 10 bacteria collected, a gauge chart showing their bellybutton washing habits, and a bubble chart showing all of the bacterial cultures per sample.
